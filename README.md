Integrating engineering tools begins within operations of our power company. World class service for our customers means that if the problem at hand doesn't affect a customer, then we're not solving it. It's core power ranges that are key: frequency, voltage, reserve capacity. These parameters affect customers without their knowledge only their wrath. If the frequency starts deviating from 60 hertz, then your power system is becoming unstable like it did in Texas in February of 2021. Rolling blackouts have catastrophic consequences to customers.

Engineering succeeds with contingency or scenario analysis to steer away from the hazards. I use Ray Dalio's book *Principles* as a guide. Let history be our guide.
